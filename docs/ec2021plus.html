<p>Takže ČR má výdaje fragmentované mezi mnoho kategorií, je relativně
atypická ve vysokých investících do městské dopravy. V top 10 vůbec
nemáme zvyšování efektivity budov (kromě veřejné infrastruktury - co se
za tím skrývá?)</p>
<p>Česko má nejvyšší fragmentaci klimatických výdajů do témat v Evropě -
a podobně velkou mají velké země jako Itálie, Polsko, Francie a
Německo.</p>
<p>U klimatických opatření je vidět větší koncentrace napříč EU než u
celkové alokace.</p>
